~TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.~

---Week 1---
    - Learnt how to navigate around Visual Studio Code
    - Not all commands and syntaxes are clear as of now
    - Installed programs in class to prepare for future coding (there are quite a few programs needed in order to code)

Edit: Should try and get started with the labs for next week so I can have questions to ask in class.
