TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Spent the week looking at and review past exercises, still trying to figure out specific function calls related to reading and writing JSON files.
Was able to look at new datasets for open data-project to see if it was more optimized to what I was looking at, still gauging if it is worth changing.
