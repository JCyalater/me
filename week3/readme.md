TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Wow, exceptions are annoying. I need to work on keeping my code clean by understanding what each line means rather than rely on google. There are also loop orders than I need to understand, spent a long time fiddling with the Exercise 3 guessing game as indentation and ordering of loops were not logical. 

This week covered using loops in more specific ways to enact a set of rules to solve problems. A lot of trial and error was needed to create a working block of code. 

Update: 
Instead of working through all aspects of the code to run the number guesser at once, splitting up the task into separate functions is much easier to grasp, trouble shoot and work through.
