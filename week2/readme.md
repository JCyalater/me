~TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.~

---Week 2 Lab---
This week was much more challenging than last week, learning python involves more googling than what I had initially thought. 

    - Exercise0 focused on basic functions involving strings and integers
    - Exercise1 focused on interpreting what each line of code means
    - Exercise2 focused on correcting invalid syntaxes and also the use of the list function
    - Exercise3 focused on using python to complete basic tasks which included the use of:
	
        - Basic functions and patterns
        - Lists
        - Appending
        - if/else/elif/for loops

Stack overflow was useful in searching for solutions for specific issues I had.
Still unclear with the logic of some of the code in Exercise 3, such as with certain loops.
Also need to expand my knowledge of possible unused functions that would have simplified some of my code.

Enthused for what's to come.
