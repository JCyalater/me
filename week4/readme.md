TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

For this week, the hardest part was grasping the code and commands involved in interpreting and extract data from online.
The json to python commands were simple but took a while to grasp, especially the line
//the_json = json.loads(r.text)
which decodes the json objects into python.

An interesting concept that I learnt this week was the process of calling data through python.
Opening, reading, writing and closing commands seem very useful. Will definitely use this in the Open Data Project.
